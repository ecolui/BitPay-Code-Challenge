## BitPay Code Challenge

### Instructions
Please use angular 4 to build the attached mockup of a numpad. Tapping each number on the numpad should add that number to the display at the top. Feel free to use animations as you see fit. Please publish to a github repository when ready to submit your work.

### Solution
I used Ionic 2 (Angular 4) to complete this challenge.  I made sure to isolate the keypad in its own component so that I can reuse it later, if needed.  Also, I use ngrx/store for central state managment (like React Redux).  I'm planning on doing way more with this little tool in the near future, just because it'll probably be fun.  Details of what I'm brainstorming are in the *home* button in the app.

### With the Ionic CLI:
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Then, to run it, cd into `BitPayChallenge` and run:
$ ionic serve -lab

Thanks you, and enjoy your day!
