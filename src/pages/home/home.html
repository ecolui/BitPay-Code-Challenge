  <h2>Pushup Monitor</h2>
  <p>
    This is just a little exercise (no pun intended) for Luis Somoza to enjoy.
    Thanks to the wonderful people at BitPay for the exercise.    
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of the exercise was to create a mockup screen of a user that logs his/her pushups.
    I completed that, but I plan on doing the following as well pretty soon:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>let users log other types of exercises (e.g. situps, jumping jacks)</li>
    <li>other units of measures in addition to reps (e.g. pounds for weight lifters, mph for runners)</li>
    <li>map weeks to dates with a calendar</li>
    <li>let user log workouts on a daily basis as opposed to weekly</li>
    <li>let users archive the current workout history and start from scratch (e.g. week 1).
        Starting from scratch will give users the opportunity to begin a new, different workout routine.
    </li>
    <li>let users create a network. They should be able to see each others data and encourage each other.</li>
    <li>
        Include a 'summary page', possibly using d3.js
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement way more automated unit tests
    </li>
    <li>
        Incoporate centralized state management (like redux in react)
    </li>
  </ul>
